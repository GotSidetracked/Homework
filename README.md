All required packages should be in Homework.csproj 
Will need to set up a PostgreSQL database (DBContext is set up)

Swagger was used for simple documentation
(Code is not perfect and honestly I feel like I could have worked more on it. At least creating extra DTOs for adding objects, but it is what it is)

Worked for roughly 8 hours +- 30 min
